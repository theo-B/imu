Code for interfacing with the Pololu AltIMU v3.

Currently this is basically just a wrapper for the minimu9-ahrs, which takes just the Euler angles from the output of that program. Hopefully it'll be integrated into the quadcopter at some point.

Requires DavidEGrayson's minimu9-ahrs program, found here: https://github.com/DavidEGrayson/minimu9-ahrs
